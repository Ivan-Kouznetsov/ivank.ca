            <h2>Quick Facts</h2>
            <h3>Education</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience">neuroscience</a> and science in general,
                    to pursue that interest I obtained a degree in
                    <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/psychology.html">psychology</a> from <a href="https://www.sfu.ca">
                    Simon Fraser University</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    While I was a student, I presented a talk on <em>Localization of the medial prefrontal cortex using
                    fMRI</em> at the 17th Annual Meeting of <a href="https://www.csbbcs.org/home">The Canadian Society for Brain,
                    Behaviour and Cognitive Science</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    While I was a student, I volunteered as a research assistant at a
                    <a href="http://www.christofflab.ca/">neuroscience lab</a>
                    at the <a href="https://www.ubc.ca">University of British Columbia</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Subsequently, I worked as lab coordinator at that same neuroscience lab
                </li>
                <li>
                    I also like <code>programming</code> and studied it on my own and at the
                    <a href="http://bcit.ca">British Columbia Institute of Technology</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Work</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    After the neuroscience lab, I worked as a web developer for many years
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then I transitioned to quality engineering (test automation and related matters)
                </li>
                <li>
                    I currently work at <a href="https://www.slalombuild.com/">Slalom Build</a> where I do quality engineering on
                    various projects for financial and online shopping companies
                </li>
                <li>
                    Previously I worked at <a href="http://ea.com">EA</a>, but not on the games
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Thoughts</h3>
            <p>
              My opinions are unfortunately not binding on other people, although they are right
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Child labour is bad. No, your lemonade stand did not teach you business skills, neither did your paper route.
                You should have spent that time exploring ideas instead of training to become a worker unit.
              </li>
              <li>
                100% of people "teaching you to be rich" are lying.
              </li>
              <li>
                You might not know what "evidence" means. It means an observation that cannot be explained by anything other than your hypothesis,
                it is your responsibility to rule out alternative explanations, not your critic's responsibility to prove alternative explanations -
                that's how evidence-based reasoning works.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Fun facts</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>This website is hosted on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> using S3, Cloud Front, and Route 53, which is colossal overkill for such a simple website</li>
              <li>저는 외국 언어를 공부 하기 재밌는 것 같아요</li>
