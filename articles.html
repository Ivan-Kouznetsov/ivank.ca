            <h3>It's better to be precise than to be not wrong</h3>
            <p>
                People, understandably, do not like being wrong, especially if they have an intellectual profession since
                they may see not being wrong as part of their job. One way to avoid being wrong is being right, but being
                right is difficult, being vague is another approach and is very easy to do, that's why most people go with
                vagueness. Consider how experts define software testing, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4NxATz8aR0">
                in an interview titled What is Software Testing?: A Conversation with Michael Bolton</a>,
                software testing consultant, trainer, and avid conference presenter
                Michael Bolton (not the singer) is asked "What is software testing?" this is his answer:
            </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>So they've been lots of definitions over the years, one definition that we used in Rapid Software Testing for
                    quite a while was "questioning a product in order to evaluate it" another example would be a Jerry Weinberg's
                    assessment of it, he never actually said it explicitly, he kind of hedged and avoided saying something too specific,
                    but the closest he came to in his book Perfect Software and Other Illusions About Testing was "gathering information
                    in order to inform a decision" Kim Keiner who is one of the most admirable figures in the whole history of
                    software testing developed a sort of consensus definition with a bunch of people who attended some conferences
                    wherein he said and I am going to try to remember this exactly "which is software testing is an empirical technical
                    investigation of software done on behalf of stakeholders with the intention of revealing quality related information
                    of the kind that they seek how about that" and can you tell Kevin was a lawyer? But that covers all the bases...
                    </p>
                    <p><cite> - Michael Bolton</p>
                </blockquote>
            <p>
                These definitions may indeed "cover all the bases" but what they don't do is give you any useful standard for determining
                what is testing and what isn't. Many things are empirical analyses but are not testing, arguably every part of the
                software development lifecycle include an empirical analysis, is everything developers do testing?
            </p>
            <p>
                A precise definition is more useful not because it is always going to be right but because every time it is shown to be wrong
                it can be improved and definition that is so vague that is meaningless cannot be shown to be wrong and thus will never be amended to be
                more accurate.
